Add pagination to WooCommerce shortcodes

== Description ==
WooCommerce shortcodes do not have pagination by default. This is a simple plugin that adds it, using the default woocommerce_pagination function.

The plugin enables pagination for the following shortcodes:

* product_category
* recent_products
* featured_products
* best_selling_products
* top_rated_products
* sale_products
