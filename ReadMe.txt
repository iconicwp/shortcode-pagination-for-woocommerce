Add pagination to WooCommerce shortcodes

== Description ==

**Due to changes in WooCommerce 3.2.4, this plugin no longer works. I've looked into ways to get it working again but I'm coming up empty.**

**Feel free to take a look for yourself and [submit a PR](https://github.com/iconicwp/shortcode-pagination-for-woocommerce) if you find a solution, but for now I can't figure out a way to get this working again. Sorry :(**

WooCommerce shortcodes do not have pagination by default. This is a simple plugin that adds it, using the default woocommerce_pagination function.

The plugin enables pagination for the following shortcodes:

* product_category
* recent_products
* featured_products
* best_selling_products
* top_rated_products
* sale_products
